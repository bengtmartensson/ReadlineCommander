# ReadlineCommander
Command line interface to interactive programs using Readline and Harctoolbox.

This is not integrated in Harchardware since I do not want the latter
(and thus IrScrutinizer) to be dependent on [Java Readline](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/java-readline).
(and its JNI library).
