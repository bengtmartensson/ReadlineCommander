# ReadlineCommander
Command line interface to interactive programs using Readline and Harctoolbox.

This is not integrated in [HarcHardware](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/HarcHardwareBundle)
since I do not want the latter
(and thus IrScrutinizer) to be dependent on [Java Readline](https://github.com/aclemons/java-readline),
and, in particular, its JNI library.
